# RoadTrip Runner

## Description
RoadTrip Runner provides users with the tools to create carefully-curated and memorable road trips. Authorized users interact with a clear and easy-to-use interface in which users enter their starting and ending locations, and then the application renders a map with those locations as well as all National Parks along their route. Users can select National Parks to add to their trip and then save the trip for future reference. RoadTrip Runner allows the everyday user, young or old, to plan their ideal National Park tour.

This repository holds the server side of RoadTrip Runner, version two, in which the co-creators redesign the backend of the app to utilize the Java Client for Google Map Services; this repository connects to another repository that contains the client side of RoadTrip Runner, version two.
